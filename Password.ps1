The purpose of this script is to email all users that their password is about to expire
days before the password expires. It is also to give them the various instructions on how
to change their password in various environments (Like working away from the office on a
domain-connected laptop).

Requirements: Active Directory module - installed with RSAT.

Edit the variables below to match your environment. Create a scheduled task to run it daily
at the time you wish. The action of the scheduled task should have the "Program/script"
field as the path to PowerShell on that server.
eg: %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
The arguments line should have "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass " and then the path to this script.
eg: -ExecutionPolicy Bypass C:\Scripts\Email-PasswordExpiry.ps1

			### Message Body for email
			$MsgBody = @"
<p>$UserName,</p>
<p>Your Windows password expires on $ExpiryDateForEmail. You have $DaysLeft days left before your password expires. 
Please change your password <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">before</span> it expires to prevent
an interruption of services (files, computers, printers, email, etc).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">To change your password:</span><br>
Please change your Windows password by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL and selecting "Change a Password".</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Are you out of the office?:</span><br>
For those people who are out of the office, please make sure you are connected to the VPN when you try to change 
your password, or you won't be able to change it. Please then Lock your computer (CTRL+ALT+DEL &gt; Lock this 
computer), and unlock it with your new password. This will force Windows to check with the domain controller and 
pull down your latest password that grants you access to resources.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Do you have a Mobile Phone with your email on it?:</span><br>
After you change your password, if you have a mobile phone with your email on it, you will need to update the 
password on your phone to continue to receive emails.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Not at a work computer? No problem:</span><br>
If you are not able to change the password on your PC or Laptop, you can always visit https://owa.server/owa/ and 
change your password from within the Outlook Web App (Settings Cog in the top right &gt; Change Password). This 
does NOT work on iPads using Safari.</p>
